## Hello, I'm Giselle!

I'm currently taking Data Structures and Machine Organization courses in C/C++. I have experience in web development but also a growing interest in systems programming that I would like to further develop via personal projects and internships. Outside of coursework, I enjoy browsing thrift stores and used bookshops for vintage tech and books about vintage tech and computing!

In the past, I've collaborated on...
1. ["Campus Treasure Maps"](https://github.com/weblab-class/necoxt-acetabularia-giselle-galan) - This website was developed for MIT's Weblab class/competition. It allows users to (1) create interactive treasure maps and/or (2) browse user-created treasure maps and hunt for the treasure.
- For (1), users build the treasure map by dropping pins on one of 3 map templates (the MIT tunnels map, the official MIT map, or a building's blueprint). At the pins' real-world locations, the map creators have hidden clues (e.g. a formula that must be correctly solved) to the next location.
- For (2), the treasure seeker chooses a map, views and visits the first location, finds the hidden clue, enters the correct answer/key on the interative map page to reveal the next pin, roceeds to the next pin/location, and so on, until eventually they reach the location of the hidden treasure. The idea behind this website was to help new MIT students and/or campus visitors to familiarize themselves with the campus layout and notable campus landmarks and spaces. Front end: Javascript, Figma. Back end: Node.js, MongoDB.

Personal Projects 
1. TCP/IP Stack (Coming Soon) - Exploring network and systems programming by implementing a TCP/IP stack in C.
