## Hello, I'm Giselle!

I'm currently taking Data Structures and Machine Organization courses in C/C++. I have experiece in web development, and I am enjoying learning systems programming and networking in my free time. Something else I love doing in my free time is browsing thrift stores and used book stores for vintage tech and vintage books about tech! 

In the past, I've collaborated on...
- ["Campus Treasure Maps"](https://github.com/weblab-class/necoxt-acetabularia-giselle-galan) - This website was developed for MIT's IAP 2020 Weblab class/competition. It allows users to (1) interactive treasure maps and/or (2) to browse user-created treasure maps and hunt for the treasure. For (1), users build the treasure map by dropping pins on one of 3 map templates (the MIT tunnels map, the official MIT map, or a building's blueprint). At the pins' real-world locations, the map creators have hidden clues (e.g. a formula that must be correctly solved) to the next location. For (2), the treasure seeker chooses a map, views and visits the first location, finds the hidden clue, enters the correct answer/key on the interative map page to reveal the next pin, roceeds to the next pin/location, and so on, until eventually they reach the location of the hidden treasure. The idea behind this website was to help new MIT students and/or campus visitors to familiarize themselves with the campus layout and notable campus landmarks and spaces. Front end: Javascript, Figma. Back end: Node.js, MongoDB.
